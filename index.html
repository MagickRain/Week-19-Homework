                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>Through my time as a student at UM, and as a graphic designer, I have learned that research is the cornerstone of all design projects. Knowing your client and your users is paramount! Striving to bring together client ideas and goals while also bringing a product that end users will love is a huge part of my process as a designer.</p>

                <h3>Empathy</h3>
                <p>When striving for inclusivity and accessibility, the importance of being empathetic with your users can’t be understated. Understanding how what many would consider outliers see and interact with the world can take a good product to a great one.</p>

                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>Between school and freelancing I have used a multitude of programs to aide in the design process. Some of my preferred ones include Figma, InVision, Miro and Adobe XD. I’m constantly finding and testing new programs I find to add to my repertoire, as technology is continuously evolving! </p>

                <h3>Creative Design</h3>
                <p>Design has been a passion of mine since I was in high school, and it’s one I’ve continued to feed through the years. Hours of studying color and color theory, design through the years and how to draw in users through visuals have helped me become the designer I am today. These are skills that I will continue to foster beyond my time at UM. </p>
